Coding assignment for Allan Gray application screening.  See the [task description](ASSIGNMENT.md).

I took this as an opportunity to learn Scala, which I have been wanting to do for a while, so it's entirely possible my use of the language is not very idiomatic.

## Prerequisites

* [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) 2.11.6
* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) 0.13.8

## Running

Run unit tests with `sbt test`

Run the application with `sbt run`

## Notes

### Concurrency
